    <p>A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is
        visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance
        and capacity.

        Types of web developers
        Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and
        full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these
        roles.</p>
